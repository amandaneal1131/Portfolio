                "I am excited about always learning new things and obtaining new knowledge. That is one of the many reasons I am in the cohort. I received a BS in GIS, a BA in Music Education, and a minor in Art. I am a mom, and I am always looking for ways to better
                my family and support them. Currently, I am a first grade teacher. I have been in the field coming up on 19 years. I have held many positions in the field ranging from TA to teacher, lead teacher, GT Coordinator, IB Coordinator, Academic
                Interventionist, Instructional Coach, and School Director. I am looking for a major change in roles and pace in my career that will work with my family better. So, I am being a risk-taker and leaping straight into Full Stack through UT-Austin
                and Computer Science classes through Harvard. I love all animals! I also love playing the piano and composing symphony scores and singing opera. And, as far as food? I love all food! I feel I am a pretty easy going person looking to make
                the best out of life."
